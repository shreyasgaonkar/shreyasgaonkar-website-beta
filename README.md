## About Me

I am a Freelancer Web Developer focusing on front-end development. I design and develop websites optimized for all mobiles and tablets to get rich User Experience. I design websites by putting in enough time keeping in mind about the client and use the correct Typography and color scheme that will go with the theme.

I use Grunt as my primary task runner and rely on CSS preprocessor for further optimizing the website. I also incorporate SEO so that the website is not lost in the search engine pages.
