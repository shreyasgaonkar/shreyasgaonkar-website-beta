                    I created this page specifically to address a few thoughts and questions that might pop up while you are here. It should give you a good sense of what I think and why I do this work.

                <h2>So, why are you in this field?</h2><hr />
                <p>
                    I get this question ALOT and I love answering it. Even though being a fundamental question of why do I do what I do, it is not a straight-forward answer to the question.
                </p>

                    I have been always been amazed by technology and how it affects our lives so much. But I never really cared about being that someone who makes it, untill I watched an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHLmIuszMTY&list=PLMdDrIM5JRUme22_46uO8KZDG_A6ob_Ce&index=15">old interview</a> of Steve Jobs.

                    <span class="ion-quote"></span> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.
                </i></p>
                <p>
                    Creating something that will touch people's lives some way or the other is really an amazing thing.

                   The answer to why I am more <i>Visual</i> person, lies in the genes. My father is a great artist, but his skills never reflected in mine, atleast directly; it all came back to me as digital artist.
